ive never heard of a workflow in my life, what in the world is this homework talking about. 
"Since you are learning about git in your class, your groupmates have asked you to propose a software development workflow for this project'
thats a stupid reason to have a person make a whole workflow. like really, its like asking a guy who can make paper airplanes to build a real plane. 
i know simple git commands, not project managment. 



love you if you actually read this :*
