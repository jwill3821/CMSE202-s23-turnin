ive never heard of a workflow in my life, what in the world is this homework talking about. 
"Since you are learning about git in your class, your groupmates have asked you to propose a software development workflow for this project'
thats a stupid reason to have a person make a whole workflow. like really, its like asking a guy who can make paper airplanes to build a real plane. 
i know simple git commands, not project managment. 



love you if you actually read this :*


i really had to come back and make a new damn branch and do all the things again because i have no idea if they want me to do this like my 'workflow' says or not. this is stupid and i hate this so much its pointlesss

if youre actually reading this just know i still love you, i just hate this type of stuff in homework.
